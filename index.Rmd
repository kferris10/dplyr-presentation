## dplyr

A new R package written by Hadley Wickham and Romain Francois (Wickham and Francois, 2014)

It provides a "flexible grammar of data manipulation"

> * Identifies the most important tasks in data manipulation and makes them easy to use
> * Provides blazing fast performance by writing key code in C++
> * Uses the same interface to manipulate data frames, data tables, and databases

---
## Common functions

1. `tbl_df`: for printing data.frames nicely
2. `select`: for choosing columns in a dataset
3. `filter`: for choosing rows in a dataset
4. `arrange`: for reordering rows in a dataset
5. `mutate`: for adding new columns to the dataset
6. `group_by`: for creating a grouped dataset
7. `summarise`: for summarizing a dataset

---
## Baseball data for an example

Who hit the most home runs for one team since 1920?

```{r lahman}
library(Lahman)
head(Batting)
```


---
## 1. Print data.frames with `tbl_df()`

Prints nicely and prevents you from accidentally printing the whole dataset.

```{r tbl_df}
library(dplyr)
batting_df <- tbl_df(Batting)
batting_df
```

---
## 2. Select columns with `select()`

Subset columns by name

```{r select}
batting_s <- select(batting_df, playerID, yearID, teamID, G, H, X2B, X3B, HR)
batting_s
```

---
## 3. Filter rows with `filter()`

Chooses rows that match your criteria criteria

```{r filter}
batting_f <- filter(batting_s, yearID > 2000, HR > 10)
batting_f
```

---
## 4. Arrange rows with `arrange()`

Reorders rows

```{r arrange}
batting_a <- arrange(batting_f, yearID, desc(HR))
batting_a
```

---
## 5. Add new columns with `mutate()`

Adds new columns

```{r mutate}
batting_m <- mutate(batting_a, X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR)
batting_m
```

---
## Steps so far

1. Turn data.frame into a tbl with `tbl_df`
2. Select columns with `select`
3. Select rows with `filter`
4. Arrange rows with `arrange`
5. Add new columns with `mutate`

---
## Nested, Unreadable Code

```{r nested-code}
mutate(
  arrange(
    filter(
      select(
        tbl_df(
          Batting), 
        playerID, yearID, teamID, G, H, X2B, X3B, HR), 
      yearID > 2000, HR > 10), 
    yearID, desc(HR)), 
  X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR)
```

---
## Chaining

`dplyr` provides the `%>%` operator.  

```{r chaining}
x <- 1:3
prod(cumsum(x))
x %>% 
  cumsum() %>% 
  prod()
```

> * This executes one command, **THEN** executes a second command.

> * This makes your code much more readable.

---
## Chaining Example

```{r chain-ex}
Batting %>%                                                 # takes the Batting data.frame, THEN
  tbl_df() %>%                                              # turns it into a tbl_df, THEN
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, G, H, X2B, X3B, HR) %>%  # selects the columns, THEN
  filter(yearID > 2000, HR > 10) %>%                        # filters the rows, THEN
  arrange(yearID, desc(HR)) %>%                             # reorders the rows, THEN
  mutate(X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR)                          # adds columns
```

---
## 6) Grouping with `group_by()`

Created a grouped tbl where operations are performed "by group"

Not really useful on its own, so let's combine it with...

--- 
## 7) Summarizing with `summarise()`

Summarize each group in a tbl

```{r group-summarise}
batting_m %>%            # take the batting_m tbl_df, THEN
  group_by(yearID) %>%   # groups it by year, THEN
  summarise(sum(HR)) %>% # sums HR for each yearID, THEN
  head()                 # prints the first six years
```

---
## `dplyr` is much, much, much, faster

```{r comparison}
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(dplyr = batting_m %>% group_by(yearID) %>% summarise(sum(HR)), 
               plyr = ddply(batting_m, .(yearID), summarise, sum(HR)), 
               agg = aggregate(batting_m$HR, list(year = batting_m$yearID), sum), 
               tapp = tapply(batting_m$HR, list(batting_m$yearID), sum), 
               times = 500L)
```

---
## `dplyr` is even faster than `tapply` when there are many groups

```{r comparison2}
microbenchmark(dplyr = batting_m %>% group_by(yearID, playerID) %>% summarise(sum(HR)),
               tapp = tapply(batting_m$HR, list(batting_m$yearID, batting_m$playerID), sum), 
               times = 500L)
```


---
## So who hit the most home runs for one team since 1920?

```{r home-runs}
result <- Batting %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  filter(yearID >= 1920) %>% 
  group_by(playerID, teamID) %>% 
  summarise(HR = sum(HR), 
            years = paste(min(yearID), max(yearID), sep = ":")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(HR))
head(result)
```
<!--
---
## Joining with the `join()` verbs

`dplyr` implements SQL style joins with `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `semi_join()`, and `anti_join()`

```{r join}
inner_join(batting_m, Master)
```
-->

---
## Other cool `dplyr` features

* `dplyr` implements SQL style joins

```{r join-2}
inner_join(result, Master %>% select(playerID, nameLast)) %>% head()
```

* can connect to SQL databases, run SQL code outside of R, then pull the results into R
* `dplyr` uses the same commands whether the data are stored in a database or loaded into R

---
## Other cool `dplyr` features

* other people are actively providing enhancements to `dplyr`
   * `tidyr` for reshaping data
   * `assertr` for making assertions about the data
   * `magrittr` and `pipeR` for chaining
   * `Rcpp` for speeding things up

## The NYC Flights Data

The `flights` data from the `nycflights13` package contains information on every flight that departed NYC in 2013.

```{r flights-data}
library(nycflights13)
dim(flights)
```

---
## Some Practice Problems

1. To make viewing easier, turn it into a `tbl_df`
2. Sometimes delay on arrival or departure is missing
3. We'll only use the year, month, day, distance, dep_delay, arr_delay, carrier, and tailnum columns.  Select only these columns.
4. Create a new column for total delay which is delay on departure plus delay on arrival.
5. Practice chaining by combining these four steps into one with the `%>%` operator.
6. On what day did the longest delay occur.  
7. Use `group_by` to find the average and total (sum) of delay for each month.
8. Which airplane had the longest delays on average? Which carrier did it belong to?

---
## More Practice problems

9. Use `ggplot2` to make a [plot of delay vs distance]().  What can you learn from this plot? (Hint: the answer is almost nothing).
```{r flights-plot1, echo=FALSE}
f <- flights %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
  select(year, month, day, distance, dep_delay, arr_delay, carrier, tailnum) %>% 
  mutate(tot_delay = dep_delay + arr_delay)
p1 <- qplot(distance, tot_delay, data = f)
```


10. There are so many data points that the plot doesn't tell us much.  We need to summarize the data.  The `tailnum` column is a unique identifier for each airplane.  For each airplane, calculate the average distance flown, the average delay, and the number of flights out of NYC (the `n()` function may be useful).
11. Use `ggplot2` to plot delay vs distance and make the size of the points proportional to the number of flights.  Add a smoother to the plot.  You're result should [look like this]().
12. Does is appear that longer flights have longer delays?  Why might this be?

```{r flights-plot, echo=FALSE}
plot_dat <- flights %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
  select(year, month, day, distance, dep_delay, arr_delay, carrier, tailnum) %>% 
  mutate(tot_delay = dep_delay + arr_delay) %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(tot_delay), 
            avg_dist = mean(distance), 
            count = n()) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, avg_dist < 2000)
# plot by airplane
p2 <- ggplot(plot_dat, aes(avg_dist, avg_delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_size_area()
```
